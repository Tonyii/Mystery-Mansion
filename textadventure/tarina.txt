It was a dark and stormy night when Lord Chadwick hosted his party. You remember that falling tree cut out the electricity.
Phones were dead and you were the only one without a chauffeur. So you stayed the night.
You wake up with a slight hangover and terrible headache. Suddenly you hear a high scream from the upstairs. You could swear
that it is Lady Sonya. Screaming stops but you can still hear definite sobs and people running towards upstairs.
You get up, put your pants and shoes on and run upstairs too. The scene is horrifying. Lord Chadwick lies dead on his bed.
No sign of violence is shown. Looks like has been scared to death. You have known Lord Chadwick a long time and know that he is good
in making enemies. Everyone here is as much guilty as innocent. And it is your job to find out who is behind this horrible
act
